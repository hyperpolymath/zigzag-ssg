**The definitive Zig static site generator.**

== Overview

zigzag-ssg is a high-performance static site generator written in Zig.
It provides zero-overhead abstractions and compile-time execution
for maximum efficiency.

== Language Enforcement

[IMPORTANT]
====
This SSG **MUST** be written in Zig. No exceptions.

Forbidden languages for SSG logic:

* Python
* JavaScript/TypeScript
* C/C++ (use Zig)
* Rust (different satellite)
* Any language other than Zig

The **ONLY** non-Zig code allowed is the ReScript MCP adapter in `adapters/`.
====

== Features

* Compile-time execution (comptime) for zero-cost templates
* Manual memory management without garbage collection
* Excellent C interop for existing libraries
* Cross-compilation from any host
* Small, fast binaries

== Requirements

* Zig 0.11+
