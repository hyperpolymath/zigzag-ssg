**High-performance static site generator in Zig.**

Zero-overhead abstractions and compile-time templates for maximum speed.

== Who Is This For?

* **Zig developers** seeking native tooling
* **Systems programmers** who need web content
* **Performance obsessives** who count every byte
* **Anyone wanting** comptime template validation

== Why zigzag-ssg?

=== Comptime Templates

Templates are evaluated at compile time. Invalid templates don't compile. Zero runtime overhead.

[source,zig]
----
const page = comptime template("base.html", .{
    .title = "My Site",
    .content = @embedFile("content.md"),
});
----

=== Zero Allocations

Hot paths allocate nothing. Content streams directly from disk to output. Memory usage stays flat.

=== Cross-Compilation

Build your site generator for any target from any host. ARM, x86, WASM - your SSG goes everywhere.

=== C Library Integration

Need ImageMagick for thumbnails? libxml for XML sitemaps? Zig's C interop makes it seamless.

== Quick Start

[source,bash]
----
# Build
zig build

# Create a site
./zig-out/bin/zigzag-ssg init my-site
cd my-site

# Build the site
./zig-out/bin/zigzag-ssg build

# Watch mode
./zig-out/bin/zigzag-ssg watch
----

== Features

* **Comptime validation** - broken templates won't compile
* **Allocation-free hot paths** - predictable memory usage
* **Native binaries** - small, fast executables
* **C library access** - use existing image/XML libraries
* **Cross-compilation** - build for any platform

== Requirements

* Zig 0.11 or later
